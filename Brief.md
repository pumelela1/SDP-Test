1 Overview
Time: 2.5 Hours
Submission: URL to a public repository
Git repositories tend to be very opaque to understanding. Git does not make it easy to understand how a
repo has evolved, who has had the most impact where, and what parts of the project are the most
volatile.
Your project manager has asked you to build a Repo Analysis Tool (RAT) that measures specific metrics
of a provided repository. You need to calculate these metrics for: each developer (called an author), each
file, each directory, and the entire repository. These metrics are provided below.
The RAT should be a web-app dashboard for multiple repositories. This dashboard should be filterable
by:
• A repository
• An author
• A file or directory
• Commits
‣ a specified period of time
‣ or a manually selected list of commits
It accepts a repository in two forms:
1. A zip file of the repo with the .git file or directory
2. A remote repository URL that is then deeply cloned

Not every commit will have the same author, even if they were made by the same person. To address
this git provides a .mailmap to merge different email addresses, the RAT should be able to merge
authors using the mailmap. If no mailmap is provided, a user should still be able to merge different
authors manually.
The full list of features are:
• Repository Upload: Zip and Clone URL
• Multiple Repository Support
• Author Merging
• Metric Categories:
‣ File Metrics
‣ Directory Metrics
‣ Repository Metrics
‣ Commit Set Metrics
Note: Not all features are necessary. Please review the rubric to understand what is needed.
2 Metrics
A commit ℎ has the following properties
• A single author ℎ[𝑎] after author merging
• A previous commit ℎ[𝑝]
‣ The initial commit has ℎ[𝑝] = ℎ∅, an empty commit
• A committer date ℎ[committer-date]
• ℎ[𝐹 ] is the set of all files
‣ Binary files are not measured
‣ Git provides a definition and detection of binary files
• ℎ[𝐷] is the set of all directories
• An object 𝑜 ∈ ℎ[𝐹 ] ∪ ℎ[𝐷] is identified by its path
‣ Rename detection is enabled with a threshold of 50%, so just renaming a file should not change its
metrics.
– Making a change and renaming an object should only have the changes impact its associated
metrics.
– These changes are attributed to its new path
‣ If an object is deleted (it does not exist in ℎ but does in ℎ[𝑝]), it should be recorded as a change in
the necessary metrics (lines removed) on its path.
The set 𝐻̄ is the set of non-merge commits reachable from a specified reference commit ℎ𝑟 (typically
HEAD)
• A commit set 𝐻 is a subset of 𝐻̄
• The commit set 𝐻𝑡 is the commit history from UNIX timestamp 𝑡 to present
𝐻𝑡 ≔ {ℎ ∈ 𝐻̄ | 𝑡 ≤ ℎ[committer-date]}
• The commit set 𝐻𝑖,𝑗 is the commit history from timestamp 𝑖 inclusive until timestamp 𝑗 exclusive
𝐻𝑖,𝑗 ≔ {ℎ ∈ 𝐻̄ | 𝑖 ≤ ℎ[committer-date] < 𝑗}

• 𝐻[𝐹 ] is the set of all files in the repository
𝐻[𝐹 ] ≔ ⋃
ℎ∈𝐻
(ℎ[𝐹 ] ∪ ℎ[𝑝][𝐹 ])
• 𝐻[𝐷] is the set of all directories (including the root) for the commit set.
𝐻[𝐷] ≔ ⋃
ℎ∈𝐻
(ℎ[𝐷] ∪ ℎ[𝑝][𝐷])
2.1 File Metrics
• File Added Lines: The number of lines added on file 𝑓 from a commit ℎ to the previous commit
𝑙+
ℎ,𝑓
• File Removed Lines: The number of lines removed on file 𝑓 from a commit ℎ to the previous commit
𝑙−
ℎ,𝑓
• File Growth: The change in number of lines on file 𝑓 from a commit ℎ to the previous commit
𝛿ℎ,𝑓 ≔ 𝑙+
ℎ,𝑓 − 𝑙−
ℎ,𝑓
• File Churn: The number of changed lines on file 𝑓 from a commit ℎ to the previous commit
𝜆ℎ,𝑓 ≔ 𝑙+
ℎ,𝑓 + 𝑙−
ℎ,𝑓
2.2 Directory Metrics
An immediate object is an object that is directly below the specified directory
foo/
bar.txt -- immediate child of foo
baz/ -- immediate child of foo
beef.py -- immediate child of baz
dead.py -- immediate child of baz
A file 𝑓 is in a directory 𝑑 at a commit ℎ if it is in ℎ[𝐹 ] or ℎ[𝑝][𝐹 ] and is an immediate child of 𝑑.
Similarly for subdirectories 𝑑′ and ℎ[𝐷], ℎ[𝑝][𝐷].
• Directory Added Lines: The number of added lines across all immediate subdirectories 𝑑′ and files 𝑓
in directory 𝑑
𝑙+
ℎ,𝑑 ≔ ∑
𝑓∈𝑑
𝑙+
ℎ,𝑓 + ∑
𝑑′∈𝑑
𝑙+
ℎ,𝑑′
• Directory Removed Lines: The number of removed lines across all immediate subdirectories 𝑑′ and
files 𝑓 in directory 𝑑
𝑙−
ℎ,𝑑 ≔ ∑
𝑓∈𝑑
𝑙−
ℎ,𝑓 + ∑
𝑑′∈𝑑
𝑙−
ℎ,𝑑′
• Directory Growth: The net growth across all immediate subdirectories 𝑑′ and files 𝑓 in directory 𝑑

2.3 Repository Metrics
Repository metrics are directory metrics on the root of the commit tree.

3 Rubric
Requirements are cumulative. You can only reach a tier if the previous tier is satisfied. Each tier is
judged holistically.
Metric correctness is determined against a set of test repositories. Sample metrics from each of these
repos will be provided from a specific commit hash. These repos are open source.
Provided repositories:
• cJSON https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON.git
• Redis https://github.com/redis/redis.git
• Git https://github.com/git/git.git
